## Jobs

### Profile
Kaccie grew up in Shelton, WA but left town to pick up a couple degrees from Rochester and a PhD from Berkeley. Dr. Li joined Smart Vision Labs in April 2015 as Principal Scientist after stints at Abbott Medical Optics and Brien Holden Vision, and as of early 2017 he became the company’s first Chief Scientist. He brings deep knowledge in wavefront estimation/control and low-cost optics manufacturing. More importantly, he’s one of the few Asian-American Dutch speakers in the world and can (almost) snatch a 32-kg kettlebell

### Advice
1. For the sake of continuing education as a scientist, try to attend one big scientific conference at least every other year.

### Recruiter
Hi Michael,
Thanks for contacting me. I think I might be a fit for this role. If you recall, I have X, Y, Z in my background. Remember though that I’m earning $1,000,000 base, and if you think that wouldn’t deter your client, then I’m open to talking. Can we set up a time to talk further about this position?
Thanks for your time,

### Mark Jellison
Mark Jellison is an exceptional athlete and health/fitness professional. I have known him for almost a decade as of mid 2014, and he never ceases to amaze me with his energy and enthusiasm in helping his clients achieve their fitness goals and sometimes even a little more. Not only does he coach and teach a myriad of classes in his community, he personally reaches out and gets to know many of the students/clients. Most recently Mark has helped me get become more disciplined with my nutrition and develop healthier habits, and it has pulled me out of almost falling into a serious fitness slump. I highly recommend Mark's service - he's professional, reasonable, and WILL guide you to be the best version of you no matter who you are.

### James Zavislan
Hi Jim,
Time sure flies doesn't it? I still often find myself reminiscing my struggle through my undergrad years, and how they passed so quickly. I seriously hated your classes because I couldn't dominate them like those typical physics/math courses. But till this day, I still often dig through old handouts and notes from 261 and 242 and learn new things. Thanks for being a caring teacher and valuable mentor.
