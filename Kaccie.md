### Mark Jellison
Mark Jellison is an exceptional athlete and health/fitness professional. I have known him for almost a decade as of mid 2014, and he never ceases to amaze me with his energy and enthusiasm in helping his clients achieve their fitness goals and sometimes even a little more. Not only does he coach and teach a myriad of classes in his community, he personally reaches out and gets to know many of the students/clients. Most recently Mark has helped me get become more disciplined with my nutrition and develop healthier habits, and it has pulled me out of almost falling into a serious fitness slump. I highly recommend Mark's service - he's professional, reasonable, and WILL guide you to be the best version of you no matter who you are.

### James Zavislan
Hi Jim,
Time sure flies doesn't it? I still often find myself reminiscing my struggle through my undergrad years, and how they passed so quickly. I seriously hated your classes because I couldn't dominate them like those typical physics/math courses. But till this day, I still often dig through old handouts and notes from 261 and 242 and learn new things. Thanks for being a caring teacher and valuable mentor.
